  CollaborativeModerationExplanations: " <p> When an element is added or modified,\
    \ the data is not updated immediately. The element will first appear ‘greyed out’\
    \ on the map and it becomes possible for all logged users to vote once and once\
    \ only about the change. This vote is not an opinion but knowledge sharing. If\
    \ you know this element, or know that the element does not exist, then we want\
    \ your knowledge! </p> <p> After a number of votes, the element can then be automatically\
    \ validated or rejected. In case of dispute (presence of positive and negative\
    \ votes), a moderator will check it out as soon as possible. We count on you!\
