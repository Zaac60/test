  ElementFormGeocodingHelp: Don’t put any punctuation, the name in all capitals are
    not accepted either. If the localization doesn’t work (some addresses do fail
    to be recognized), enter the name of the nearest town or village then click on
    ‘Localize’ and put the localization point manually. Re-enter the complete address
    into the text area, skip the ‘Localize’ button and continue to fill in the form.
  CollaborativeModerationExplanations: " <p> When an element is added or modified,\
    \ the data is not updated immediately. The element will first appear ‘greyed out’\
    \ on the map and it becomes possible for all logged users to vote once and once\
    \ only about the change. This vote is not an opinion but knowledge sharing. If\
    \ you know this element, or know that the element does not exist, then we want\
    \ your knowledge! </p> <p> After a number of votes, the element can then be automatically\
    \ validated or rejected. In case of dispute (presence of positive and negative\
    \ votes), a moderator will check it out as soon as possible. We count on you!\
